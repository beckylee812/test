<p>The Acme Brickpit has won a tender to produce custom bricks for a 
construction company. The construction company will be building one or two 
buildings using these bricks. The contract between Acme and the company 
stipulates that Acme is to supply 160,000 bricks for the first building this month 
and, if <span id="question_brick_entry_1">both buildings are built</span>, 
another 160,000 bricks in four months' time. It will be paid 7 per brick.
</p>
<p>It will cost Acme $350,000 to set up for a production run of the bricks, 
regardless of how many bricks it makes at that time, plus $5 per brick. If it 
decides to <span id="question_brick_entry_2">make all  $320,000 bricks 
</span> in a single run then it will also cost $30,000 to store the second 
half of the bricks until they are needed for the second building (even if it does 
not go ahead). If it decides to only <span id="question_brick_entry_3">make 160,000 bricks  in the first run </span> then there will be no storage cost (and 
the second 160,000 bricks will not be made if the second building does not 
go ahead) but the $350,000 set up cost will need to be paid again if the 
second building does go ahead.</p>
<p>However, the second building is not guaranteed to proceed. If <span 
id="question_brick_entry_4"> one building only </span>is built then Acme 
will have to sell the extra bricks on the open market, where it expects to only 
get $1 per brick because of their unusual design.Acme believes that 
the probability of the second building proceeding is 0.39.Monetary 
values should be answered to the nearest dollar. Probabilities should be 
answered to three decimal places. Do not include dollar signs or commas.
